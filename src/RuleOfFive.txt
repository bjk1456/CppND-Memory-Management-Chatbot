The Rule of Five
By adding both the move constructor and the move assignment operator to our MyMovableClass, we have adhered to the Rule of Five. This rule is an extension of the Rule of Three which we have already seen and exists since the introduction of the C++11 standard. The Rule of Five is especially important in resource management, where unnecessary copying needs to be avoided due to limited resources and performance reasons. Also, all the STL container classes such as std::vector implement the Rule of Five and use move semantics for increased efficiency.

The Rule of Five states that if you have to write one of the functions listed below then you should consider implementing all of them with a proper resource management policy in place. If you forget to implement one or more, the compiler will usually generate the missing ones (without a warning) but the default versions might not be suitable for the purpose you have in mind. The five functions are:

The destructor: Responsible for freeing the resource once the object it belongs to goes out of scope.

The assignment operator: The default assignment operation performs a member-wise shallow copy, which does not copy the content behind the resource handle. If a deep copy is needed, it has be implemented by the programmer.

The copy constructor: As with the assignment operator, the default copy constructor performs a shallow copy of the data members. If something else is needed, the programmer has to implement it accordingly.

The move constructor: Because copying objects can be an expensive operation which involves creating, copying and destroying temporary objects, rvalue references are used to bind to an rvalue. Using this mechanism, the move constructor transfers the ownership of a resource from a (temporary) rvalue object to a permanent lvalue object.

The move assignment operator: With this operator, ownership of a resource can be transferred from one
